            Pelican (scientific name: Pelecanus occidentalis) is a species of pelican that lives in America. Its range extends to the coasts of North, Central and South America, as well as to the shores of nearby islands, such as the Galapagos Islands.
            <br/> <br/> 
The brown pelican is the smallest species in the pelican family. It is about 106 to 137 cm long, and weighs 2.75 to 5.5 kg, while its wingspan is about 1.83 to 2.5 meters. As with all species of pelicans, the brown pelican has a very long beak relative to its body size, and is about 28 to 34.8 cm long; at the bottom of its beak is a yellow sac, in which the water is drained while the pelican is hunting.
<br/> <br/> 
The head and neck of adult pelicans are white and sometimes, in some adult pelicans, it gets a yellowish tinge. The beak is mostly gray, and during the breeding season its lower part is painted red. His abdomen, back, tail, legs and wings are dark gray.
<br/> <br/> 
It nests in colonies, usually in isolated islands that are free of terrestrial predators. The brown pelican hunts in flocks, and is one of two species of pelicans that hunt by diving, along with the Peruvian pelican that resembles it in appearance .. The brown pelican tends to incubate its eggs by standing on them so that its legs warm them. The nest is usually placed on the ground or on tops of trees, and the male shakes his head to attract a female.
