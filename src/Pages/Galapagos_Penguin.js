            <div className='text1'>The Galapagos penguin (scientific name: Spheniscus mendiculus) is a penguin endemic to the Galapagos Islands, the only living in the equator. It can survive in this environment thanks to the cold that the Humboldt current brings with it, as well as thanks to the Cromwell current. The creatures closest to it are the penguins that share with it the genus Belt Penguin: the black-footed penguin, the Humboldt penguin and the Magellan penguin. Its main habitats are the island of Fernandina in the Galapagos Archipelago, as well as the western shores of Isabela Island. Smaller populations are scattered throughout the rest of the islands.</div >

           <h2>Reproduction</h2>
           <br/> <br/> <br/>The Galapagos penguin breeds two to three times a year, because they do not have a defined breeding season (a result of the lack of seasonal changes due to the proximity to the equator). For this reason, they usually reproduce depending on environmental conditions and food supply. It turns out that most penguins reproduce between May and July. However, the weather and food supply may be volatile during the year, so the timing of the breeding seasons cannot be predicted correctly. It is generally a monogamous species, meaning that individuals mate with the same mate for the rest of their lives. For this reason, every year only a small proportion of adult penguins are required to find a mate or partner.
           <br/>

Both the new penguins (which is their first breeding season) and the old ones (which is not their first breeding season) are courting their mate. Prominent courtship practices include mutual feather cleaning, patting each other with the help of the wings and friction of the beaks. The pairs of penguins will build the nest before mating, and nurture it until the eggs are laid (the size of the nest is usually two eggs). Both parents share all the chores, including incubating and finding food. The incubation period is between 38 and 42 days. After 60 days from hatching the chicks go through the flowering stage, and they will reach full independence within three to six months. Females reach sexual maturity at the age of three to five years, and males between the ages of four and seven. </div>

<h2>anatomy</h2>
<div><br/> <br/><br/>The Galapagos penguin is one of the smallest penguins. It is the only penguin that has crossed the equator from south to north to the northern hemisphere, and hence is the penguin with the northernmost distribution. 90 percent of the Galapagos penguins live off the coast of the islands of Fernandina and Isabella, and the rest are found in the islands of Santiago, Bartolema, Santa Cruz and Florana.

The penguin is 48 to 55 centimeters tall and weighs 1.7 to 2.6 kilograms. Their heads are black. A thin white U-shaped line begins behind the eye, continues behind the ear and ends at the chin and neck. Their backs are black-gray, and their bellies are white. Two prominent black straps are on the chest. The young individuals differ from the adults in the head (all black), and the chest (the black stripes are absent). The females are smaller than the males, and apart from this difference they are similar. They feed on flaming fish, especially mollusks, sardines and sometimes crabs. They pick up their food during the day, and do not tend to stray too far from their nesting site. They may dive to a depth of 30 meters in order to obtain their food. They are highly dependent on the cold water currents that lift their food from the water from the depths of the ocean.

<h2>diet</h2>
<div><br/> <br/>
<br/>Galapagos penguins are carnivores, feeding on small fish (those not exceeding 15 millimeters in length) of all species, as well as other marine invertebrates. They use their short wings to swim in the water, and their small, powerful beak to capture their prey. They usually hunt in groups, and will usually capture their small prey from below. These are relatively sociable creatures. They live in large colonies, thus deterring possible predators. Their short legs and small wings make their walk look awkward, also due to the lack of a stable balance. Their swimming is light and agile.  </div>

<h2>Life expectancy and state of preservation </h2>
<div>
<br/> <br/><br/> 
Penguin Galapagos' life expectancy ranges from 15 to 20 years, however, many of them are preyed upon, starve to death, experience climatic disasters or are harmed by humans, and therefore do not reach normal life expectancy. Its natural predators include mice, crabs, snakes, hawks, owls, cats, dogs, sharks and other large marine animals. Their body colors are used as camouflage: a predator looking at them in the water, from above or below, will see their body blend into the background (dark or light, depending on the direction) and will have a hard time noticing them. They defend themselves madly by making loud noises, direct attack and fluttering their wings; These defenses are more effective when the penguins stand as a group facing the predator.
<br/>
The conservation status of the penguin is defined as "endangered" according to the World Conservation Organization. It is included in the list of endangered species in the United States. This fact has a far-reaching effect on the depleted species population anyway. The human damage and predation by many animals on the islands also leads to a declining population. In 2004, the population size was estimated at 1,500 individuals, in a survey conducted by the C. Earls Darwin.
