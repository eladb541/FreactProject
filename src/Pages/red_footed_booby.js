            The red-footed sula (scientific name: Sula sula) is a species of seabird in the Soltai family. Sola is found in the subtropical regions of the southwestern Indian Ocean, the Caribbean, the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The soles spend most of their lives in the ocean, landing on land only to reproduce.
 <br/>
It is the smallest species of sole - about 64 to 76 cm long, its wingspan is about 91 to 101 cm, and it weighs 900-1,003 grams; The females are slightly larger than the males. As the name implies, the sole, its legs are red; Blue is covered, and there are blue and red spots on it and on the throat. There are two "variations" of the sole body color: in details from the white variation, the aviation feathers are black, and the rest of the body is white. In individuals of the brown variation, the whole body is brown. The body of the soles is suitable for long flights, in search of food. During these flights they may travel a distance of 150 km.
<br/><br/> <br/> 
The soles feed mainly on small fish and squid. They dive quickly into the water to catch the terpene; When diving, they reach a depth of about 4 to 10 meters below sea level. Because females weigh more than males, they dive deeper. Sometimes the soles are observed side by side in cooperation with other species of predators, such as dolphins or tuna, which bring flocks of fish close to the surface of the water.
<br/><br/>  <br/> 
Soles do not have a regular breeding season, and they breed throughout the year. Reproduction occurs every 15 months or so, taking into account the amount of food available. The soles are social and nest in bands, and have courtship displays, during which they showcase their legs and wings, and freeze in various poses. The female lays a single egg. Incubation lasts about 41-45 days. The chicks bloom from the nest at 91 to 139 days of age, and reach sexual maturity at 2-3 years of age.
