            The Galapagos albatross (scientific name: Phoebastria irrorata) is the only species in the albatross family that lives in the tropics for the rest of its life. It is the largest bird that lives in the Galapagos Islands. Outside the breeding season, these albatrosses live mainly in the coastal areas of Ecuador and Peru. Its life expectancy ranges from 40 to 45 years.

Galapagos albatrosses are medium-sized birds. They are 86 cm long and weigh 3.4 kg. Their wingspan is about 2.27 meters. Their uniqueness is expressed in their neck and heads, which are painted pale yellow, as opposed to their bodies, most of which are brown. An even more prominent feature is their long beak, painted light yellow - the latter Large disproportionately large in size and head.For young individuals application of soft heat.Galpagus albatrosses feed mainly on fish, squid and carcinogens.Sometimes they will survive on non-fresh food, such as food scraps digested and vomited (raised by ruminants) by other birds.When hunting The albatross will focus on an area in the ocean where its prey tends to swim near the water.It may hunt and prey away from its chicks.
<br/><br/><br/>
Galapagos albatrosses nest only on the island of Espanyola, which belongs to the Galapagos Islands. The reeds are built in areas with lava, basalt rocks and little vegetation. The courtship methods are special and spectacular. They feature speed bumps, quick clicks and loud noises while lifting the head and beak up. The eggs are laid between April and June, and the incubation period lasts two months. Two weeks after hatching, the chicks stay together in a kind of "nursery", while the parents fly to the sea to find food. On their return, the parents feed their chicks large amounts of oily fish that they have already digested themselves (the food is passed on to the offspring when it is digested). Parents may feed their chicks more than two pounds of oil. The appearance of the chicks in their growth is awkward and unattractive. The chicks reach full size by December, leaving the colony a month later. The male and female mate with each other and remain loyal to each other until the day one of them dies.
<br/><br/><br/>
Galapagos albatrosses are known for their highly developed aviation skills. They can fly for several hours non-stop. The aviation technique they often use is aviation with wind and prolonged diving. This way they take advantage of the wind speed at an altitude of more than 15 meters above sea level - the wind allows them to soar while investing a relatively small effort. However, their large wings and slender body make it difficult for them during takeoff and landing. To relieve themselves during takeoff, they usually take off from cliffs. During takeoff at sea, however, they are aided by their feet covered with a swimming membrane, wind and waves.
<br/><br/><br/>
The albatross population of the Galapagos living in the area is protected by the local national park staff. However, other factors interfere with them and put them at risk: limited natural range, capture of a side trap, disturbance to tourists, diseases and the effect of illegal hunting in nearby waters. The factor responsible for the main damage to the species is probably trapping as prey by fishermen, which led to a change in its risk assessment by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) in 2000: from "close to risk" to "vulnerable". In 2001, the number of adult individuals was estimated at 34,700, but it seems that since then its population has begun to show a declining trend at an unknown rate. In addition, capture as a side effect appears to harm males more than females, and thus the relationship between the sexes is also impaired. As the current state of affairs threatens the extinction of the population to the point of extinction, its conservation status changed to "grave danger of extinction" in 2007.
