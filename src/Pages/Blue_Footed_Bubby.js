            The blue-footed sole is a species of chicken in the Sulidae family.

The natural habitat of the blue-footed sole is tropical and subtropical islands off the Pacific coast of South America, from Peru to Mexico, including the Galapagos Islands, their most famous distribution area, where their population is abundant. Their population is also large in parts of California.

The species is not endangered in terms of conservation status, and its population is very dense in some areas.

           <h2>Reproduction</h2>
           <br/> <br/> <br/>
          The courtship in the blue-footed sole is done while the male shows off his legs by raising them towards the head and dances to create an impression on the female. During the dance the male spreads his wings and stomps on his feet. The blue-footed sole is an animal with monogamous relationships, but sometimes there are bigamy systems. The reproductive cycle of the species is eight to nine months, and it does not depend on the season and date, but is done spontaneously and adaptively. In mating, the female walks in a demonstration and the male turns his head and tail towards the sky and turns his wings backwards in an act of bragging to the female. The male also makes a loud, shrill whistling sound.

The size of the hen is two or three eggs, from which hatch a chick or two. The eggs are laid at intervals of about five days. Incubation is performed by both parents, alternately, and when one of them does not incubate - he serves as a supervisor. Because the blue-footed sole does not have an area that is not covered with feathers (an area that helps heat the eggs during incubation; brooding patch), it uses its legs to keep the eggs warm. Incubation lasts about 41-45 days. The chicks are not able to maintain their body heat until they are about a month old. The blue-footed sole is one of two species in the genus Sola that breed more than one chick. This may be due to the special diving abilities of the male's shallow water. The chicks need frequent feeding, so the adults have to hunt fish regularly. The parents catch fish, digest them and then raise it back (raising rumen) and put the digested food (which is easy to digest) into the mouths of their offspring. In case the parent does not have enough food to feed all his chicks, he will feed only the largest of them, to ensure that at least one of his offspring will survive. The blue-footed soles can protect two or three nesting sites, before deciding on a preferred nesting site a few weeks before laying. The reeds are built on a bare black lava. The soles build their nests in a large reed colony. The male and female share the mutual responsibility to care for the offspring: the male takes care of the food supply for them at an early stage of their lives due to his developed diving abilities, and the female takes command as the demand for food on their part increases.

<h2>anatomy</h2>
<div><br/> <br/><br/>
The size of the blue-footed sole is medium to large: its length is 81 cm on average and its weight is 1.5 kg on average, with females slightly larger than males. It has long, pointed wings and a triangular tail. Her neck is thick and strong. Its eyes are located on both sides of the apex and face forward, and have a sharp binocular vision; Her eyes are yellow, while the male's irises are yellower. The blue-footed sole has nostrils adapted for diving that are closed for the rest of its life. Breathing is done through the tips of the mouth. The color of the legs ranges from pale turquoise to dark aquamarine; The color of the legs in males and young individuals is lighter than that of females.

<h2>diet</h2>
<div><br/> <br/>
<br/> 
The diet of the blue-footed sole consists entirely of fish. The sole are expert fish hunters, and they feed mainly on juvenile fish species such as sardines, anchovies, mackerel and flying fish. In addition to these, the soles eat squid and the remains of other marine animals. They dive into the ocean waters, sometimes from great heights, and swim in the water in pursuit of prey. The solo sometimes hunted alone, sometimes in pairs, and other times even in large bands. In group hunting, the leading sole dives into the water first, thus signaling everyone to dive together to catch the fish. During the hunt, they can dive into the water from a height of more than 60 meters, reach a speed of more than 90 kilometers per hour, and dive to a depth of about 25 meters below the water surface. By bringing food to their offspring, the parents digest the food, raise it (raise rumen) and serve it to the offspring.

<br/> <br/>
The blue-footed sole produces loud, polyphonic moans or shouts and thin whistling sounds. The males are also known to turn their heads up and whistle at a female flying around.
