            <div className='text1'>The Galápagos tortoise complex or Galápagos giant tortoise complex is a species complex of 15 (13 extant and 2 extinct) very large tortoise species in the genus Chelonoidis (which also contains three other species from mainland South America). They are the largest living species of tortoise, with some modern Galápagos tortoises weighing up to 417 kg (919 lb). With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years, they are one of the longest-lived vertebrates. Captive Galapagos tortoises can live up to 177 years.For example, a captive individual, Harriet, lived for at least 175 years. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish galápago, meaning "tortoise".

The Galápagos tortoises are native to seven of the Galápagos Islands. Shell size and shape vary between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks; on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with "saddleback" shells and long necks. Charles Darwin's observations of these differences on the second voyage of the Beagle in 1835, contributed to the development of his theory of evolution.
<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
Tortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 15000 in the 1970s. This decline was caused by overexploitation of the species for meat and oil, habitat clearance for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and pigs. The extinction of most giant tortoise lineages is thought to have also been caused by predation by humans or human ancestors, as the tortoises themselves have no natural predators. Tortoise populations on at least three islands have become extinct in historical times due to human activities. Specimens of these extinct taxa exist in several museums and also are being subjected to DNA analysis. 12 species of the original 14-15 survive in the wild; a 13th species (Chelonoidis abingdonii) had only a single known living individual, kept in captivity and nicknamed Lonesome George until his death in June 2012. Two other species, C. niger (the type species of the complex) from Floreana Island and an undescribed species from Santa Fe Island are known to have gone extinct in the mid-late 19th century. Conservation efforts, beginning in the 20th century, have resulted in thousands of captive-bred juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands, and the total number of the species is estimated to have exceeded 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. Despite this rebound, all surviving species are classified as "threatened" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Galápagos tortoises are one of two insular radiations of giant tortoises that still survive to the modern day; the other is Aldabrachelys gigantea of Aldabra and the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean, 700 km (430 mi) east of Tanzania. While giant tortoise radiations were common in prehistoric times, humans have wiped out the majority of them worldwide; the only other radiation of tortoises to survive to historic times, Cylindraspis of the Mascarenes, was driven to extinction by the 19th century, and other giant tortoise radiations such as a Centrochelys radiation on the Canary Islands and another Chelonoidis radiation in the Caribbean were driven to extinction prior to that.

In May 2021, a genetic test carried out by scientists from the California Academy of Sciences confirmed that a single female tortoise discovered during a 2019 expedition to Fernandina Island is from the species Chelonoidis phantasticus.

<div className='text1'>The massive tortoise has a dull brown-colored bone armor. The armor plates are attached to the turtle's ribs in a rigid and protected structure that is part of the skeleton. Acne often grows on the armor of the Galapagos turtles. The armor pattern is preserved throughout the turtle's life. Measuring the age of the turtles according to the growth rings of the armor is not effective because the outer layer wears out over time. The turtle can pull its head, neck and front limbs into the armor for protection. The legs are large, thick and short, and are covered with dry, scaly skin. There are five claws on the front legs. On the hind legs four claws.
<br/><br/><br/>
Galapagos turtles are the only giant turtles to have a number of armor formations. The armor configurations range from a saddle-like armor that rises high above the turtle's front, creating the impression of a saddle, to a round dome-like armor around the turtle's body. When turtle-like armored turtles pull their head and front limbs into the armor there is a large, unprotected space left above their necks, evidence that these turtles did not suffer from madness when this structure developed. There is no unequivocal duality of a dome-like configuration versus a saddle-like configuration, and different subspecies present a wide spectrum of structures ranging from the two configurations. In larger, higher (over 800 meters) and wetter islands, such as Santa Cruz, there is a proliferation of vegetation close to the ground. In such islands the turtle population tends to exhibit a more dome-like structure, and are larger and have shorter necks and legs. Turtles with a saddle-like armor structure usually come from smaller, lower (less than 500 meters) and drier islands where the amount of vegetation and resources is more limited (like espanola and pinson). This phenomenon is also more moderately known in the giant land tortoise Matul aldebra.

Galapagos turtles are cold-blooded, so they must lie in the sun for an hour or two after dawn in order to absorb the sun's heat through their dark armor before setting out for food for 8-9 hours a day. They move between grazing areas and resting areas mainly in the early morning and late afternoon. Galapagos deer were observed moving at a speed of 300 meters per hour.

In the larger and wetter islands the turtles migrate between low-lying areas covered in grass during the rainy season, to pastures in the higher areas (up to 600 meters) during the dry season. These migration routes have been used by generations of turtles, which has led to the creation of vegetated paths, known as "turtle highways". In islands where there is plenty of water, the domed tortoises are sociable and usually live in large herds, in contrast to the saddle-like tortoises that live in the drier islands, which have a tendency to be territorial and solitary.

On cool nights the turtles sometimes rest in mud puddles, or in shallow pools of rainwater. This habit probably helps both regulate body temperature in cool weather, and as protection against parasites like mosquitoes and ticks. Another way to fight parasites is through dust baths in sandy soil. A number of turtles have been observed taking shelter at night under protruding rocks, inside depressions in the ground or vegetation. These resting places are called "pallets". Local turtles return to the same sites (e.g. the Elsado volcano on Isabela Island) and use the same mattresses, creating small pits in the sandy soil.

The Galapagos tortoises are mostly reverberations, feeding on cacti, grass, leaves, lichens and grapes. They have been observed feeding on Hippomane mancinella, "poisonous apple", on Psidium galapageium, an endemic species of guava, on the water fern Azolla microphylla and Tillandsia insularis from the bromeliad family (to which the pineapple also belongs). Turtles eat an average of 32-36 kg of vegetation a day, but the inefficient digestion process of these turtles results in most of the food being excreted without their nutritional value being utilized.

Turtles get most of the fluids they need from the dew and debris of the plants they eat (especially sabra-type cacti); And in light of this are able to spend long periods without drinking. The turtles are able to survive for 18 consecutive months without food and drink at all, while their bodies break down fat reserves, a process one of whose byproducts is water. When thirsty they are able to drink very large amounts of water in a short time, and store them in the blisters and at the base of the neck (heart pocket), a fact that has made them a useful source of water on ships. In arid islands, turtles lick the morning dew from rocks, which over the generations has created hemispherical depressions in the rocks.

Reproduction occurs in all seasons, although it reaches a seasonal peak between February and June in high and humid areas during the rainy season. When adult males meet each other during the breeding season they will face each other and maintain a characteristic control display while stretching their legs and neck with their mouths wide open. Sometimes one turtle will bite the other, but usually the lower turtle will retreat and allow the winner to mate with the female in dispute. This behavior is especially noticeable in saddle-like armor strains, which are more aggressive and have a longer neck.

Introduction to mating can be extremely aggressive. 
<br/><br/>
The male will slam the female's armor with his own armor, pinching her legs. Climbing the turtle on the back of the turtle is a cumbersome process during which the male has to stretch and stabilize in order to maintain balance while standing on a slope. The concave lower part of the armor helps him maintain balance while riding on the female's armor and brings his gutter opening (where his penis is also located) closer to its extended gutter opening. During mating, the male makes loud, hoarse snoring sounds that have been described as "rhythmic growls." This is one of the few sounds the tortoise makes. Additional sounds are heard during battles among themselves as they try to straighten themselves and the whispering sound heard as a result of the air pressure as they pull their legs and neck into the armor

From July to November, the females travel several kilometers to reach the nesting areas - dry and sandy beaches. Digging the nest is a complex and tedious process, and the female will have to work several hours each day for long days until she completes the craft. The female performs the excavation work with her hind legs only, without seeing the result. It digs an elongated pit about 30 cm deep and lays up to 16 eggs in it. The shape of the eggs is round and they have a hard shell. They weigh between 82 and 157 grams and are about the size of a billiard ball. According to some observations, on average, Females of the dome-like armor breeds more eggs than females of the saddle-like armor breeds (average of 9.6 eggs per laying for the dome-like armored porteri breed from Santa Cruz Island, compared to an average of 4.6 eggs per laying in the saddle-like duccanesis breed from the island of Pinson. The female seals the nest). Made from soil mixed with urine which it compresses with the help of the bottom of its shell and leaves the eggs to warm up in the sun.Women will lay up to four litters in each laying season.

Temperature has an effect on the species of turtles that hatch. In the cooler nests a majority of males will hatch and in the warmer nests a majority of females will hatch. This is related to the incubation and laying time. At the beginning of the laying season the temperatures are colder and the incubation period is longer, which will lead to the hatching of more males. Eggs laid at a later stage when the temperatures are warmer will require a shorter incubation period, which will lead to the hatching of more females.
